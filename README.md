# Luna Jump
*This game was written as a final project for the 'Programming in C++' course at HWR Berlin.*

## About
Luna Jump is a game inspired by the Google Chrome Dino Jump game (try it by visiting a website using chrome without internet connection). The player character is one of my cats (Luna) and the obstacles are different pictures of my other cat (Lilo). The game has a trashy design on purpose, to go with the rather silly idea of using funny cat pictures as sprites.
